# flstudio-tools

Some scripts to help with FL Studio upgrades/migrations.

Currently just a WSL bash script used for migrating certain settings from one version of FL Studio to another -- useful when installing a beta version or upgrading FL Studio version.  Currently copies across the recently used files, MIDI device settings, file path settings and window settings.

Edit the script as you see fit.
